# How do I compile/run my code

For convenience we've supplied some execution scripts that will compile/run code with the `--add-modules` flag set (for Java FX). Use `javac.sh` to compile on Linux and Mac OS, or `javac.bat` to compile on Windows. Likewise, use `java.sh` to run on Linux and Mac OS, or `java.bat` to run on Windows. E.g.

```
$ ./javac.sh src/MazeApplication.java  
$ ./java.sh MazeApplication
```
